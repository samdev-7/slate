# Slate firmware

As Slate uses an e-ink display, it does not require firmware to run on the device.

A second device, such as a Raspberry Pi Pico, is needed to update the contents of the display.
I am using an Orpheus Pico (the pinouts should match that of a RPi Pico), but other MCUs should work.  

Slate runs off of CircuitPython.
